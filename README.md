# MyToken Smart Contract

This readme provides an overview of the functionalities and structure of the MyToken smart contract.

## Contract Overview

The MyToken smart contract is a simple implementation of a token contract with basic minting and burning capabilities. It allows users to create and destroy tokens while maintaining balances for each address.

### Public Variables

1. **Token Name**: The name of the token. In this example, it's set to "ADITYA".
2. **Token Abbreviation**: The abbreviation or symbol of the token. In this example, it's set to "AV".
3. **Total Supply**: The total supply of tokens. Initially set to 0 and increases with minting.

### Mapping Variable

1. **Balances Mapping**: A mapping of addresses to their token balances. It keeps track of the balance of each address.

### Functions

1. **Mint Function**
   - Parameters: `address`, `value`
   - Increases the balance of the specified address by the given `value` and increments the total supply by the same `value`.

2. **Burn Function**
   - Parameters: `address`, `value`
   - Checks if the balance of the specified address is greater than or equal to the given `value`. If so, it decreases the balance of the address and the total supply by the `value`.

## Getting Started

To use the MyToken smart contract, follow these steps:

1. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy the contract to a compatible Ethereum-like blockchain platform.

2. **Interact with Functions**:
   - Call the `mint` function to create new tokens. Provide the recipient's address and the amount to mint.
   - Call the `burn` function to destroy tokens. Ensure the address has sufficient balance for the burn amount.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to interact with the MyToken smart contract using a Solidity-like syntax:

```solidity
// Deploy the MyToken contract
MyToken tokenContract = new MyToken();

// Minting example
address recipient = 0xAddress;
uint256 amountToMint = 100; // Example amount
tokenContract.mint(recipient, amountToMint);

// Burning example
uint256 amountToBurn = 50; // Example amount
tokenContract.burn(recipient, amountToBurn);
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not cover all security considerations and best practices. Ensure you understand the implications of the contract's behavior and test it thoroughly before deploying to a production environment.
